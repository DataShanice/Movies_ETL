Module 8 Movies - ETL
## Analysis 
### During this analysis, many assumptions can be made. The way in which we needed to extract the data was more extensive and required many different techniques to aquire. We found that the data pulled from the IMDB database gave us the alot of data that needed to be structured and cleaned. With the Wikipedia and Kaggle data, it was important to be sure the data was in current with each other. Most of the code needed for the ETL needed to be cleaned and reconfigured in order to ensure there would not be any corrupted data.
